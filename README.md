# DESIGN-AND-EXPERIMENTAL-ASPECT-OF-KU-BAND-RECEIVER


The aim of the work is to design, develop and test Microwave passive components. Additionally the project objective is to design and develop Electronic Warfare Receiver (Super Heterodyne Receiver) with active and passive components according to the specifications provided. To meet the aim, the following objectives are to be fulfilled.
1.	Understanding the design of microwave receiver, its power budget, and design of microwave passive components, filters and its approximations to transfer functions. 
2.	Understanding the efficient design simulation tool.
3.	Identifying the improved practical design consideration for accuracy and realization.
